Simulate the evolution of a population in a given number of years
At each iteration(unit of time-eg. year) you have to introduce:
-Acres to buy/sell(+/-)
-Units to feed the population
-Acres to plant
After you introduced this informations,the app will compute(at each iteration):
-number of people that starved
-number of people that came to the city
-the population of the city
-number of acres of land owned by city
-the harvest (units per acre)
-number of units ate by rats
-land price(units per acre)
-number of grain stocks in units

At the end,the app will tell you how well you managed the population
