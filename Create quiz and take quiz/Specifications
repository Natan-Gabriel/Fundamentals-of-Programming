I have an app that allows me to add questions,create quizzes with them and take quizzes already created
Functionalities:
1.add:
example of command: add 12;Which number is not prime?;2;32;11;32;easy;
this fct will add a quiz with 3 options and a correct answer(32) and with a given diff
2.create:
example: create easy 4 sample.txt
creates a quiz on a given difficulty
with a given number of questions
and this quiz will be stored in 
a file specifed in args
3.start(take):
use this fct to take an already created test(which is stored in a file);
this function will also show you the result
for example: start sample.txt


In master.txt you have all questions
In sample.txt you have an example of quiz
